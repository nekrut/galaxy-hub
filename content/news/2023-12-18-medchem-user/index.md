As a medicinal chemistry student, I undertook a semester project on natural products isolation and derivatisation. One of the compounds my group was working on was piperine, extracted from black pepper. Inspired by literature findings, we found out that the derivatives of piperine can inhibit monoamine oxidase-B and thus can be possibly used in Parkinsonâ€™s disease. As a novelty element in our project, we came up with new structures of derivatives that could act as inhibitors.
